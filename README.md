INSTALLATION / SETUP:
*********************


For installation instructions, information, frequently asked questions and support options,
please open the following url (located in the .zip you downloaded) in your browser:


music-store/docs/index.html


- DO NOT remove or modify the 'licence.lic' file unless asked to do so.
- DO NOT edit PHP files in a word processor, use a good quality text editor. Notepad is fine.
- If pages don`t load, check there is NO whitespace in the file before the opening PHP tag, or after the closing one.
  An edit you made may have affected the file, bear that in mind before reporting bugs.
  If you do have an issue, check the "logs" folder.
